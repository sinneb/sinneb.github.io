  The sinneb.net domain expires in a couple of weeks. Since I&rsquo;m more and more using social media to show progress and be in touch and furthermore only keeping the contents of my blog archived for reference, I decided to cancel my contract with the webhoster and switch to a static page on github pages using the Hugo framework. Sorry for the broken links, you can easily use your browsers search on the homepage to find what you need - each post is listing with the first 200 characters or so.

  In the previous post, I investigated the possibility to replace the CA3046 and expo pair with modern components in a synthesizers&#8217; exponential converter, while retaining the temperature compensation. Continuing on the findings from the previous post, I worked out a schematic:
CV inputs are summed in opamp U7, then scaled with regard to temperature over R1 through R4 for the expo converter build up out of a BCM847DS matched transistor pair.

  Let&#8217;s get rid of the CA3046, because it&#8217;s large and almost obsolete, even the one in a SOIC package (LM3046). The temperature dependant resistor (tempco, 1k, 3300ppm) is also obsolute and very hard to source &#8211; so let&#8217;s also get rid of that. On this blog, the CA3046 part has been examined in depth, but the tempco part can use some investigation.
First the CA3046, a General Purpose NPN Transistor Array.

  After a number of important revisions, the very first reliable, stable and interesting VCO is finished! Some features:
&#8211; Instead of a classic configuration where the sawtooth core is reset by a voltage comparator and a small capacitor, this sawtooth core is reset by a Schmitt trigger configuration, allowing LFO functionality by switching on an extra capacitor in the sawtooth core. This because the reset pulse does not rely on the size of the reset-capacitor but is determined by the Schmitt trigger.

Software
 Install Rasbian (my version is 2017-04-10) Midi requires the serial device &#8220;/dev/ttyAMA0&#8221; to be exposed through the rpi0w&#8217;s header pins.

  A few pointers regarding development with an STM32F7 discovery board. My intention with this powerful board is to be able to sync wave files to a tap-tempo BPM (kinda Ableton Live like), and take the device up on stage with my band.
The board:

The STM32F7 disco runs at ~200Mhz, has support for DSP instructions (hardware floating point unit) and a lot, lot more. My first step was to make development easy, fast and &#8220;Arduino&#8221; like &#8211; since I&#8217;m really comfortable with that.

A single attenuverting channel (a 1 to 1 matrix) looks like this:

Although interesting, a more advanced matrix would offer a lot more possibilities. I decided to go for a 4 x 3 matrix, since I had those parts available.

Input of 1 is an Arduino PWM wave. This wave is passively filtered to a DC voltage (ranging from 0v to 5v). This resulting voltage will be one way to drive the voltage controlled oscillator.

  Recently I was fiddling with a set of LittleBits and I was trying to sync these (the LitteBits micro sequencer that is), to my Volca Beats. With the current lineup of LittleBits, this was impossible. Since the Volca Beats has a sync out (0V, 5V pulses with 15ms duration), the solution was not all too difficult. I just took a LittleBits wire, cut it in two, reconnected the VCC and the GND but connected the SIG to the signal connector of an 3.

  A reliable VCO needs a steady exponential converter. Exponential converter are, because of their transistor based design (needed for the exponential functions), very temperature sensitive. A number of solutions to this problem exist. A solution that looks very interesting from a technical point of view is the solution found in (among others) the Moog Prodigy. The exponential converter only needs two transistors (the matched pair) from the five transistor available in the CA3046 chip.

  The LM13700 OTA chip has an interesting schematic for a triangle VCO in its datasheet. The discreet sawtooth VCO I&#8217;m building is too complex for breadboarding and does not deliver a decent sawtooth (probably due to distortion picked up somewhere in the breadboard). Therefor I decided to give the LM13700 triangle VCO a go. The schematic in the datasheet is very clear. All I did was exchange some resistor and capacitor values to ones that I have laying around.

  Just a quick reminder how to fix the locale warnings on fresh ubuntu installs. Warnings look, among others, like this:
locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory  Fix: add this
LANG="en_US.UTF-8" LC_MESSAGES="C" LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"  to /etc/environment
Thank you MCKelvin @ askubuntu

  Time for a new post and I have an interesting prototype to share with you. Tom Wiltshire over at electric druid (http://www.electricdruid.net/) made a great writeup about the Roland Juno DCO workings (a true must read). Based upon the diagram I decided to give it a go.

_from http://www.electricdruid.net/, used with permission._
I did some redesign work, since an Arduino is a very handy a capable device for such applications.

  <time datetime="2011-10-30T12:47:50Z" class="post-date">Sun, Oct 30, 2011</time>
  Working on a project I needed extra digital in&#8217;s and extra digital out&#8217;s for my Arduino Uno (lots of LEDs, lots of buttons). I&#8217;ll use a CD4021 to extend the digital in&#8217;s and a 74HC595 to gain extra digital out&#8217;s. I decided it would be best to both access the data of the CD4021 and send data to the 74HC595 over the hardware SPI bus on the Arduino (see previous post).

Figured it out, it was actually pretty simple thanks to the easy SPI implementation in the Arduino software since version 0020 or so (?

Speed up
In the LCD3Wire library, I removed two delays:
131c131 &lt; //delay(1); --- &gt; delay(1); 155c155 &lt; //delayMicroseconds(1); --- &gt; delayMicroseconds(10);  This gives a good speed increase when using the LCD3Wire library. Furthermore, reading this post (http://solar-blogg.blogspot.com/2009/02/displaying-custom-5&#215;8-characters-on.html) I copied the code to the Arduino and displayed my own custom character (using the LCD3Wire library)

This sawtooth is generated through an orange drop capacitor (sounded better then its wima counterpart) in a 100% analog sound path. Reset pulses are generated by an Arduino and the rise of the sawtooth waveform is controlled by a MCP4921 DAC. Each frequencies requires an exact voltage to level out the sawtooth. I haven&#8217;t calibrated these voltages yet so the sawtooth isn&#8217;t very precise yet.

Best sounding values came out like this:

which I, after some thinking, recognized as the original values like in the JUNO6! Very nice! Just had to replace the 100pF capacitor with a 240pF capacitor like in the original.

  I&#8217;m not sure. Did a lot of prototyping and these are the results.
Since I couldn&#8217;t figure out a proper way to calculate the cutoff frequency when using different current and resistor combination, I decided to use the default lowpass filter circuit from the LM13700 datasheet.

Hooked my expo converter up to pin 1 (100nA &lt; Iabc &lt; 1.1mA) and started testing. The Vout of this pole is the Vin of the second pole.

  As seen in the previous post, the following formula determines the cutoff frequency of the typical LM13700 lowpass filter design:

The only variable part in this formula is the Iabc part, the incoming current from the expo converter. The cutoff frequency of the JUNO106 filter varies between 5Hz and 50000Hz (from the manual). To achieve this, Iabc low and Iabc high must differ a factor of 10000. I redesigned the expo converter as following:

  Current project status:

Using the FREQ slider on the JUNO106 results in a exponential filter control current from 32nA to 705µA. So, when feeding 32nA into the filter, its cutoff frequency should be 5Hz. Feeding the filter 705µA results in a 50kHz cutoff frequency. My LM13700 lowpass filterdesign is based on the lectures by Aaron Lanterman. This is a typical design:

resulting in the following plot (Iabc = 1mA)

  I reversed the current direction by using PNP transistors instead of NPN transistors (plus some other minor alterations). I also realized that the output current of the expo conv in the previous post (7mA) was way too high for the LM13700 (max current 1mA) so I adjusted the resistor in the iref connection to 10 megaohms! Max output to the LM13700 is now 705µA.

  Working! When moving the VCF FREQ slider from 0 to 10, the current varies from 0.3 UA (300 nA) to something above 7 mA. Looks pretty correct. Only thing I&#8217;m worrying about is the current direction. This expo is a current sink but I think I need a current source&#8230;

  Completed the exponential converter for my open source Juno 106 filter clone.

Mostly based on the great lectures by Aaron Lanterman (ECE4893A: Electronics for Music Synthesis, session 9, Exponential Current Sources). Also based on the SMR-4 filter as designed by mutable instruments. You should really check out Olivier&#8217;s work for Mutable instruments, great stuff there and the Shruthi-1 synth is just a fantastic piece of engineering. Very inspiring.

As you can see, my assumption in the previous post regarding the current on VCA CONT was wrong. Max current is not 0.5mA but 0.3mA which will lead to a different value for r3 (the current to voltage resistor).

  Long time no post. Sorry, real-life is sometimes getting in the way ;)
Recently I bought a Leaflabs Maple R5 to replace my Arduino&#8217;s. I really like it. Eventually I ported ChibiOS (realtime OS) to it and tried some software filter algorithms from musicdsp.org. Didn&#8217;t make me happy; 72Mhz isn&#8217;t enough to do serious audio filtering (at least not using my prototype coding).
New plan: use the Maple for the VCO&#8217;s (kind of DCO).

  mmmm what if the entire synth could run on 5v? Just power it over USB. It would make a perfect companion for your laptop but also very easy to install with your desktop PC. The development is also a lot more &#8220;portable&#8221;. Now I have to work with my own bulky +/-15V power supply. It would be fantastic to just work with an USB cable connection. My MacBook can charge my iPad (1A) so the USB power connection should be powerful enough to drive a (tiny) synthesizer.

  <p>At the bottom of this post you&#8217;ll find the newest code for the prototype. This code has some nice enhancements over the previous:</p>

<ul>
<li>A first begin with ADSR code</li>
<li>A better midi implementation. The Arduino keeps track of the order of notes played so note-off commands are treated right. A note-off &#8220;resounds&#8221; the previously played note. If there is no previous note (all notes-off), the output is silent; no note is played. This new implementation also leads to a better legato management.</li>
<li>A 128 values linear to logarithmic lookup table to give the ADSR (MCP42100) a musical course.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the third prototype of my DIY synthesizer. I&#8217;m using a 82c54 16-bit timer chip for the voice (one chip has three timers, so three voices should be possible). This chip divides a master clock signal (usually in the Mhz range) through a programmable 16-bit value to create a audible frequency.</p>

<p>An Arduino Duemilanove interprets the midi (CNY17) and feeds a divider value via a shift register (74hc595) to the 82c54 voice. The crystal oscillator clock ticks at 8Mhz so for a 440Hz pulse waveform (central A) the division value is 18182. This prototype cannot produce notes below midinote 47 (B) because of it&#8217;s maximum divider value (16-bit = 65.536). Future prototypes will use a clock divider (arduino itself?)</p>

<p>Oh, my synth-playing-skills are well below par ;)</p>

<p>Very much inspired by the Roland Jupiter / Juno series.</p>

<p>This is the prototype from the previous post, with the midi in hardware solution from <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1187962258/30#32" target="_blank">tetracon</a> (arduino forum).</p>

<p>Timothy Twillman has developed a great Arduino midi library. Very easy to implement, exactly what I needed. <a href="http://timothytwillman.com/itp_blog/?page_id=240" target="_blank">Check it out</a>.</p>

  <p>The second prototype uses a 74HC595 shift register to adress the datalines of the 82C54. It is now possible to send different divider values to the 82C54 and thus creating different pulse waveform frequencies.</p>

  <p>Just now I finished the first prototype using one counter on the 82C54 programmable 16-bit interval timer. This timer divides the masterclock by a programmable 16-bit integer (0-65535). When dividing a crystal masterclock, a very stable and precise pulse waveform can be achieved.</p>

  It is going to be very difficult to get a decent and stable frequency out of the prototype. I even tried removing the MCP42100 (which is obviously not created for this purpose, will use it later again in the filter), which only resulted in a little more stability. Still drifting around 3 hz when tuning at 440hz. Not acceptable for me, so I&#8217;ll go the DCO road. Inspired by the Roland Juno 106:

  The prototype is making noise and I&#8217;m tuning it to musical notes. Unfortunately the drift of various components is to high to maintain a stable tuning :( For example my 440hz A tuning:

The ppm (temperature stability) of the XR2206 is 20ppm/C, fine. The ppm of the DAC is 0.16ppm/C, even better. The ppm of the digital potentiometer (mcp42100) is 800ppm/C! That number explanes the variation in tuning. Off to find a solution!

  <p>When using the Arduino board with midi in, it&#8217;s necessary to set the baudrate to the midi standard of 31250. Unfortunately, this is a non-default baudrate so the Arduino Serial Monitor cannot display this serial data. Other solution are also dependent on standard baudrates (<a href="http://www.musicalgeometry.com/archives/55" target="_blank">here</a>) so these won&#8217;t work either. One way of working with this limitation is to switch baudrates during development, not very friendly.</p>

  <p>The XR2206 sinneb 6v is making semi-controlled noise! Check these design schematics and the sounds. Very nice I think ;) The current prototype is a combination of the XR2206 prototype, microprocessor (Arduino) controlled by the MCP42100 and MCP4912. Right now I&#8217;m working on a prototype PCB to explore the musical capabilities of the 6v&#8230; Keep you posted.</p>

<p>Updated: Eagle schematic &amp; PCB now available</p>

  <p>The heart of the sinneb 6v (really, really have to come up with another prototype name). For now one xr2206 function generator produces the base waveshapes for the 6v. The xr2206 is, according to the datasheet, capable of producing high quality sine, square, triangle, ramp, and pulse waveforms of high-stability and accuracy. For now I&#8217;m only using the sine out, but switching waveforms is definitely something I&#8217;m gonna include!</p>

  <p>The MCP42100 controls the resistance for the XR2206 function generator. Together with the MCP4921 the MCP42100 determines the output frequency. In such a configuration, it should be possible the generate exact musical frequencies. Testing will begin soon!</p>

  <p>The MCP4921 controls the sweep voltage for the XR2206. The sweep voltage and the variable resistor together are controlling the output frequency. Precise musical output frequency should be feasible this way. I will be using <a href="http://www.electricdruid.net/JunoDCOFreqError.php" target="_blank">this table</a> to check if the frequencies are correct.</p>
